# The Good Asker

## The Dilemma
You are perplexed by a question. It may have plagued you for months or it has just crossed your mind. The only thing you know… the only thing that matters is that it must be answered.

## The Failure

You asked the question and were immediately sent to this link, bringing you to me. How unsatisfying it must be to be rejected so coldly. They didn’t even give you a proper answer! How dare they waste your time, right?

## The Revelation

You’re a bad asker. I’m sorry to say it, but it’s true. You don’t know how to ask a direct question and demonstrate that you tried to solve the problem on your own. You have failed to acknowledge that these folks are volunteers and their time is important to them too. In fact, you didn’t even bother to review the carefully written documentation that would have answered your question anyway. And, much to this point, you aren’t even reading this because bad askers famously tune out when confronted with these facts. This is when you become defensive. You become angry and lash out at the helpers, further burying you in a deeper, answerless pit.

## The Solution

You’re actually a good asker! You have the potential for great things and this is how you’re going to do it:

**Try to do your own research first.** I’m not talking about preparing a dissertation. It really irks a helper if all they had to do was type your question into Google and click on the first result. Read the documentation. See what other people have already asked.

**Take a break and return to your problem later.** Walking around, taking a shower, daydreaming: these are all great ways to encourage your subconscious to solve the question on its own. When you return with renewed energies, everything is so much simpler.

**Isolate the issue.** Reproduce the problem in a simple, self-contained example. Helpers love seeing source-code, but they are not interested in deciphering your monolithic project. Sometimes doing this leads you to finding the answer yourself.

**Demonstrate the actual problem.** Use clear language to explain the issue you’re having in your question. Helpers are not mind readers and they really dislike having to ask you a bunch of questions to find out what’s really wrong. Step outside of yourself and ask “can someone understand the point of my question without any other context?”

**Pictures are great!** A screenshot will take you a long way. Annotate with circles, labels, and arrows if you think it will make the problem more obvious. What you’re not going to do is take a snap with your smartphone. Hideous! What’s not great about a picture, however, is that people can’t copy and paste the text into their editor. Never take a screenshot of code when formatted text will do.

**Don’t blame.** The editor, the framework, the language: these are not the issue. Plenty of other people have done it already and much more successfully than you. The problem is yours, so own it! Maybe your chosen path has some extra obstacles, but it can only be overcome if you choose to do the work.

**Be patient.** Go ahead and ask your question but expect a delayed response. The nature of internet help is that of waiting. Helpers are of an international cast with varying schedules and interest. Don’t be dissuaded if your question doesn’t get any traction and certainly don’t spam for attention. Only repost after a good period of time has passed and do so carefully.

**Be open to alternatives.** You think the helpers gave you the wrong answer. They had the audacity to ask you why you are doing it this way. Perhaps it was the wrong answer. Or, more likely than not, you asked the wrong question! If they're telling you that your approach is completley incorrect, they're telling you from experience. Be willing to try something else even if it goes against your instincts.

## Conclusion

Generally, if you're kind and set reasonable expectations you will find a solution. The helpers do their work because they find it enjoyable. It's not enjoyable if the question is lazy. That is just a step short of asking someone to just do your project for you! Demonstrate some thought and challenge yourself first. Ask a good question and then the answers will flow. Maybe someday you'll become a helper and understand why we ask this of you.
